minihtmlwebpackplugin

1) npm i -D mini-html-webpack-plugin, webpack-nano, webpack. Webpack-nano requires a different import syntax for mode instead of specifying it in webpack.config.js. The oritinal intent of webpack-nano was to not to have to specfiy a webpack.config.js

2) 

this doesnt have a html template file. It generates the index.html. The source code has a default index.html embedded into the code.
